// If non-delegating ctor completed successfully but delegating ctor threw then
// dtor WILL BE CALLED before entering catch.

// All constructed bases/members will be destroyed before catch clause in ctor.

// Before any catch clauses in the destructor are entered, all bases and
// non-variant members have already been destroyed. Referencing them is UB.

// Accessing base classes or non-static members in try block in ctor/dtor is UB.

// After catch clause in ctor/dtor exception is rethrown.
